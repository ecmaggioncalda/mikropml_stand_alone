# development version 

- Fixed bugs related to grouping correlated features (#276, @kelly-sovacool).
    - Also, `group_correlated_features()` is now a user-facing function.

# mikropml 1.1.0

- New correlation method option for feature importance (#267, @courtneyarmour).
    - The default is still "spearman", and now you can use other methods supported by `stats::cor` with the `corr_method` parameter: `get_feature_importance(corr_method = "pearson")`
- There are now [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmNrK_nkqBpKpzb9-vI4V7SdXC-jXEcmg) covering mikropml and other skills related to machine learning, created by @pschloss (#270).
- Fixed a bug where `preprocess_data()` converted the outcome column to a character vector (#273, @kelly-sovacool, @ecmaggioncalda).

# mikropml 1.0.0

- mikropml now has a logo created by @NLesniak!
- Made documentation improvements (#238, #231 @kelly-sovacool; #256 @BTopcuoglu).
- New option in `preprocess_data()`: `prefilter_threshold` (#240, @kelly-sovacool, @courtneyarmour).
    - Remove any features that appear in N=`prefilter_threshold` or fewer rows in the data.
    - Created function `remove_singleton_columns()` called by `preprocess_data()` to carry this out.
- New option in `get_feature_importance()`: `groups` (#246, @kelly-sovacool).
    - Provide custom groups of features to permute together during permutation importance.
    - `groups` is `NULL` by default; in this case, correlated features above `corr_thresh` are grouped together.
- `preprocess_data()` now replaces spaces in the outcome column with underscores (#247, @kelly-sovacool, @JonnyTran).
- Clarify in the intro vignette that we do not support multi-label outcomes. (#254, @zenalapp)
- Optional progress bar for `preprocess_data()` and `get_feature_importance()` using [the progressr package](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/progressr) (#257, @kelly-sovacool, @JonnyTran, @FedericoComoglio).
- The mikropml paper is soon to be published in [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03073)!

# mikropml 0.0.2

- Fixed a test failure on Solaris.
- Fixed multiple test failures with R 3.6.2 due to `stringsAsFactors` behavior.
- Made minor documentation improvements.
- Moved `rpart` from Suggests to Imports for consistency with other packages used during model training.

# mikropml 0.0.1

This is the first release version of mikropml! ðŸŽ‰

- Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
- Major new functions:
    - `run_ml()`
